/**
 * The phpLDAPadmin config file
 * See: http://phpldapadmin.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Config.php
 *
 * This is where you can customise some of the phpLDAPadmin defaults
 * that are defined in config_default.php.
 *
 * To override a default, use the $config->custom variable to do so.
 * For example, the default for defining the language in config_default.php
 *
 * $this->default->appearance['language'] = array(
 *  'desc'=>'Language',
 *  'default'=>'auto');
 *
 * to override this, use $config->custom->appearance['language'] = 'en_EN';
 *
 * This file is also used to configure your LDAP server connections.
 *
 * You must specify at least one LDAP server there. You may add
 * as many as you like. You can also specify your language, and
 * many other options.
 *
 * NOTE: Commented out values in this file prefixed by //, represent the
 * defaults that have been defined in config_default.php.
 * Commented out values prefixed by #, dont reflect their default value, you can
 * check config_default.php if you want to see what the default is.
 *
 * DONT change config_default.php, you changes will be lost by the next release
 * of PLA. Instead change this file - as it will NOT be replaced by a new
 * version of phpLDAPadmin.
